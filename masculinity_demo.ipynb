    "FiveThirtyEight, a web site about polling, sports, and statistics, worked with a few other parties to run a survey of men's relation to masculinity in the #meToo era. The discussion is here:\n",
    "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is noticeably univariate: it mostly discusses each question's responses individually, without many cross-tabulations like \"How does the likelihood of self-perceived masculinity differ between married and single?\" This is not to fault the authors, who are writing a short article for generalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the staff at FiveThirtyEight have graciously and openly posted the data. So we can do further analysis on these kinds of questions. We can look at the one posed above, or whether men are more likely to pay on dates when they self-report as high-masculinity or when they want to be _perceived_ as masculine, or how reporting as high-masculinity changes the odds of having kids.\n",

    "\n",
    "To properly do such an undertaking, the paper develops the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) statistic to answer questions about the relationship between factors. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the likelihood of moving for people who are married, relative to singles?  \n",
