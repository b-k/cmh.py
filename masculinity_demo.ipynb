    "FiveThirtyEight, a web site about polling, sports, and statistics, worked with a few other parties to run a survey of men's relation to masculinity in the #meToo era. The discussion is here:\n",

    "It is a short article for a generalist audience, and so mostly discusses each question's responses individually, without many cross-tabulations like \"How does the likelihood of self-perceived masculinity differ between married and single?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But the staff at FiveThirtyEight have graciously and openly posted the data. So we can look at that question, or whether men are more likely to pay on dates when they self-report as high-masculinity or when they want to be _perceived_ as masculine, or how reporting as high-masculinity changes the odds of having kids.\n",

(If the article is paywalled, you can <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3yHeI4g\">read it here</a>) To properly do such an undertaking, the paper develops the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) statistic to answer questions about the relationship between factors. For example,\n",
    "the likelihood of moving for people who are married is lower than the likelihood that singles move, but the married are also more likely to have kids and a mortgage. Using the CMH statistic to control for other characteristics, we find that marrieds are much more likely to move than singles.\n",

It is no surprise that influence goes in both directions, but we now have support for the claim that self-perception drives the desire for public perception more than the desire for public perception drives self-perception."

Now, the CMH calculation generates a table of numerator and denominator calculations just like the one above, but with a different row for every value of the control: one row for everybody with a kid, one row for everybody without one. That is, we're running a separate controlled experiement for every condition.\n",
