    "The analysis is noticeably univariate: it mostly discusses each question responses in turn, without many cross-tabulations like \"How does the likelihood of self-perceived masculinity differ between married and single?\" This is not to fault the authors, who are writing a short article for generalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the staff at FiveThirtyEight have graciously and openly posted the data. So we can do further analysis including the above question, or whether men are more likely to pay on dates when they self-report as high-masculinity or when they want to be _perceived_ as masculine, or whether being heterosexual raises the chance of self-reporting as high-masculinity.\n",

If I tell you that the person is non-White, then you will adjust your expectations upward.\n",

An appendix to the above paper lists several other manners in which the CMH statistic improves over correlation-based statistics like regression coefficients.\n",
